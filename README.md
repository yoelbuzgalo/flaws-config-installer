# FLAWS Config Installer for APB Reloaded game

Due to the difficulty of installing the config files to APB after every week maintenance days or updates/patch release, I've decided to make a config installer, utilizing the efficient C++ filesystem manager for a quick and easy way to install flaws config files.

Use this at your own risk. C++ is a programming language that has risks of memory leaks and can cause problems to your system when in use. I did my best making sure that this program is free of memory leak issues. Ensure that the program is properly shutdown to prevent memory leaks.

This installer works only on windows, a released version of the executable will be added later to the releases section of this github repo.
This config installer is still in development, nothing works yet! You're welcome to add this github repository to your watch list to get the most latest releases!
